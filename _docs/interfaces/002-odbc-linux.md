The MapR Drill ODBC driver provides BI tools access to Drillâ€™s flexible query
capabilities so you can quickly explore various data sources. Once you install
the MapR Drill ODBC Driver, you can configure ODBC connections to access Drill
from BI tools through the connections. Drill can connect to data with well-
defined schemas, such as Hive. Drill can also connect directly to data that is
self-describing, such as HBase, Parquet, JSON, CSV, and TSV.
