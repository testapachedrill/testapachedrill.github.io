Drill Explorer is a simple user interface that is embedded within the ODBC
DSN. Drill Explorer enables users to understand the metadata and data before
visualizing the data in a BI tool. Use Drill Explorer to browse Drill data
sources, preview the results of a SQL query, and create a view that you can
query.

The Browse tab of Drill Explorer allows you to view metadata for each schema
that you can access with Drill. The SQL tab allows you to preview the results
of custom queries and save the results as a view.

  5. In the **Schemas** section on the **Browse** tab, navigate to the the data source that you want to create a view for.  
     After you select a data souce, the metadata and data displays on the Browse tab and the SQL that is used to access the data displays on the SQL tab.
