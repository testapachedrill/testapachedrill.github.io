You can define a default input format to tell Drill what file type exists in a
workspace within a file system. Drill determines the file type based on file
extensions and magic numbers when searching a workspace.

Magic numbers are file signatures that Drill uses to identify Parquet files.
If Drill cannot identify the file type based on file extensions or magic
numbers, the query fails. Defining a default input format can prevent queries
from failing in situations where Drill cannot determine the file type.

If you incorrectly define the file type in a workspace and Drill cannot
determine the file type, the query fails. For example, if the directory for
which you have defined a workspace contains JSON files and you defined the
default input format as CSV, the query fails against the workspace.

You can define one default input format per workspace. If you do not define a
default input format, and Drill cannot detect the file format, the query
fails. You can define a default input format for any of the file types that
Drill supports. Currently, Drill supports the following types:

  * CSV
  * TSV
  * PSV
  * Parquet
  * JSON

## Defining a Default Input Format

You define the default input format for a file system workspace through the
Drill Web UI. You must have a [defined workspace](/docs/workspaces) before you can define a
default input format.

To define a default input format for a workspace, complete the following
steps:

  1. Navigate to the Drill Web UI at `<drill_node_ip_address>:8047`. The Drillbit process must be running on the node before you connect to the Drill Web UI.
  2. Select **Storage** in the toolbar.
  3. Click **Update** next to the file system for which you want to define a default input format for a workspace.
  4. In the Configuration area, locate the workspace for which you would like to define the default input format, and change the `defaultInputFormat` attribute to any of the supported file types.

     **Example**
     
        {
          "type": "file",
          "enabled": true,
          "connection": "hdfs:///",
          "workspaces": {
            "root": {
              "location": "/drill/testdata",
              "writable": false,
              "defaultInputFormat": csv
          },
          "local" : {
            "location" : "/max/proddata",
            "writable" : true,
            "defaultInputFormat" : "json"
        }

## Querying Compressed JSON

You can use Drill 0.8 and later to query compressed JSON in .gz files as well as uncompressed files having the .json extension. First, add the gz extension to a storage plugin, and then use that plugin to query the compressed file.

      "extensions": [
        "json",
        "gz"
      ]
