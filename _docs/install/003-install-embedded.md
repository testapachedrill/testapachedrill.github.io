Installing Drill in embedded mode installs Drill locally on your machine.
Embedded mode is a quick, easy way to install and try Drill without having to
perform any configuration tasks. When you install Drill in embedded mode, the
Drillbit service is installed locally and starts automatically when you invoke
SQLLine, the Drill shell. You can install Drill in embedded mode on a machine
running Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.

**Prerequisite:**

You must have the following software installed on your machine to run Drill:

<table ><tbody><tr><td ><strong>Software</strong></td><td ><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td ><a class="external-link" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html" rel="nofollow">Oracle JDK version 7</a></td><td >A set of programming tools for developing Java applications.</td></tr></tbody></table>

You can run the following command to verify that the system meets the software
prerequisite:
